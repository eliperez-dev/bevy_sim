# Ideas for Bevy Flight Simulator

## Trees/Vegetation System
- Tree models exist (`pine tree.gltf`, `tree.gltf`) but no spawning implemented
- Add biome-appropriate vegetation placement
- Implement LOD for vegetation similar to terrain chunks

## Audio System
- Engine sounds (pitch based on throttle/RPM)
- Wind sounds (volume based on speed)
- Stall warning audio cues
- Ambient environmental sounds

## Clouds & Weather
- Volumetric or billboard clouds
- Weather systems (rain, fog density changes)
- Cloud shadows on terrain


## Additional Features
- Multiple aircraft types with different flight characteristics
- AI aircraft/birds
- Mission/waypoint system
- Save/load settings and flight state
- Contrails/vapor trails
- Cockpit view with 3D instruments

## Polish & Optimization
- Async terrain generation improvements
- Better shadow cascades tuning
- Post-processing effects (bloom, color grading)
- Mouse flight controls option
